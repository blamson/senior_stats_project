# August 31st Notes

Check NAs and "?'s" for full variables Look into the almost entirely incomplete variables.

-   Are these variables actually levels of a factor?
-   If so we can combine them, or keep them as dummy variables How can we reduce the number of levels of factors?
-   This is important for the yes/no with extra notes.
-   Should this info be truncated or converted into extra levels? Are the empty variables ACTUALLY empty?
-   It's possible a missing value is actually just a "no" for example. Depends on context

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next steps: - Start with the MOST and LEAST complete variables.
- Do a bit more digging into those.

Later on: - Are there variables where missing values tend to be grouped for a row?
- In other words, are missing values correlated at all between sparse factors.
- It's possible a row missing a variable may be indicitive of missing values in other variables.

## Notes on Including Variables

### Ready

-   Pillar Size

### Maybe

-   Pluteus
-   Tablinum

### Redundant

-   Property Size
-   Percentage of Property

# September 14

Clean up and dig through the various binary variables we've looked at.
If possible, make a correlation matrix of these.

Turn 'atria' into a binary variable called "corinthian or not".
What it says on the tin.
If corinthian is in the value, 1.
If not, 0.

Also, create a new dataframe specifically for new transformed variables.
Just to help deal with the cruft.

AND, make a new excel sheet specifically for using on the home pc.
Delete all the garbage im uninterested in visually.

# September 20

Made the ID column actually unique (there was a 1 "duplicate")

Got a new dataframe using new columns.

Converted peristyle type, tablinum, and atria into binary columns

Created a correlation matrix but it is imperfect due to missing values

# October 5th notes

## Complete with respect

How complete are other rows with respect to the columns contained in width?
- Also in general here, this will be useful analysis to have - Set up a helper function for this type of analysis

## Heatmap

Setup a heatmap for walkway and portico.
Walkway 1 2 3 4 1 2 P 3 4

## Meeting notes

Column material: Stone is a good thing to look for.
They're more expensive and typically older.
- Nuanced because some older homes can be damaged by an earthquake and repairs would be done using a mix of materials - Rubble and masonry are probably not super useful.

We can ignore PPM column.
Its just for Summers reference.

## Peristyle Type

Peristyle Type Peristyle with 4 sides with columns is True 3 or less is Truncated

## Walkway/Portico sides

```         
Check how many of these have Peristyle Type
```

Is the widest walkway across the entrance or aligned with the entrance?
- parallel or perpendicular.

## Atrium/Tablinum are within the same unit of the building

```         
An NA here means there totally wasnt a tablinum as its a big feature thats hard to miss.
```

## Pluteus

```         
The directional information is sparse and useless
Pluteus can be complete or incomplete but data is too inconsistent to extract info from
If we were to use it'd be more of a "did it exist or not" yes/no boolean.
```

## Next steps

```         
- We're gonna focus on walkway widths, alignment and material. 
- How does the largest width walkway direction correlate with direction of the entrance
- Widest walkway direction is probably what we want to use. Smallest one isnt helpful.
    - Rethink widest walkway as "Dominant walkway". What direction does the dominant walkway face?
- For the 26% of data w/ walkways, how many of those are true/truncated?
- Interesting goal could be to use the columns provided in phone gallery to "predict"" the entrance direction
- Could this information also predict visibility of the peristyle???
```
