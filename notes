# August 31st Notes

Check NAs and "?'s" for full variables Look into the almost entirely incomplete variables.

-   Are these variables actually levels of a factor?
-   If so we can combine them, or keep them as dummy variables How can we reduce the number of levels of factors?
-   This is important for the yes/no with extra notes.
-   Should this info be truncated or converted into extra levels? Are the empty variables ACTUALLY empty?
-   It's possible a missing value is actually just a "no" for example. Depends on context

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next steps: - Start with the MOST and LEAST complete variables.
- Do a bit more digging into those.

Later on: - Are there variables where missing values tend to be grouped for a row?
- In other words, are missing values correlated at all between sparse factors.
- It's possible a row missing a variable may be indicitive of missing values in other variables.
